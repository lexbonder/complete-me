# Complete-Me - Alex Bonder - (FE Mod 2)

## Synopsis

Complete-me is a prefix trie used to function as a reusable autocomplete module. This functionality is featured in my Weatherly Project [Here](https://github.com/lexbonder/weatherly).

## Project Goals

* Learn how to build a data-trie
* Simulate functions of push, pop, shift, unshift, and delete within the trie
* Bundle the project to be reused as a node module
* Write meaningful, comprehensive unit and integration tests to test functionality of trie

## Installation 

Fork or clone this project
